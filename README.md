# iRobot
iRobot is a java parsed grammar and interpreted for managing a robot in a grid !
# Get Started 
You need `Jflex` installed to compile the **`lexer.flex`** file and generate **`Lexer.java`** 
To do this you can tape in terminal :
> **jflex** lexer.flex

This command will generate the class **`Lexer`** in our project.
You need also to have `Java` installed (any **JDK** is accepted for this version).

To get started with you should compile classes using this command ( Let's say we are in the project's root ) : 
> **javac** Main.java

Or 
> **javac** *.java

And Then we need to run this compiled classes by : 
> **java** Main
